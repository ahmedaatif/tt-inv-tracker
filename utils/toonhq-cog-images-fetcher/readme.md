# toonhq-cog-images-fetcher

This Bash Shell script was created to fetch all cog images quickly from the [ToonHQ website](https://toonhq.org/).

## Running the script

1. Open this directory in your terminal
2. Run `Bash script.sh`

- <i>Notes</i>
  1. You might need [WSL](https://ubuntu.com/desktop/wsl) to run Bash Shell scripts in Windows (Untested as of now)</i>
  2. <b>Do NOT run this script outside the scope of this project;</b> as it is using a relative path to access the `src/assets/cogs` directory.

3. Success! It will download all cog portraits under `src/assets/cogs`
